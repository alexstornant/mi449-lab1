    <p class="planet-desc">
        The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system. It is about one-sixth the size of Earth and has a significantly weaker gravitational force. The Moon is approximately 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. It plays a crucial role in Earth's gravitational pull, affecting tides. The Moon's surface features include plains, mountains, and impact craters formed by meteoroid collisions.
        The Moon has distinct phases as it orbits Earth, causing changes in its appearance from Earth. These phases include the new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. The Moon lacks an atmosphere, so it doesn't have weather or the ability to support life. It has been a subject of fascination and exploration throughout human history, with various space missions sent to study its surface and geology.
